## About Oniro

[Oniro](https://oniroproject.org/) is an open-source, vendor-neutral Operating System (OS) managed by the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/). It is built upon the foundational layers of [OpenHarmony](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs), an open-source project incubated and operated by the [OpenAtom Foundation](https://www.openatom.org/). OpenHarmony is known for its distributed OS features that cater to a wide range of smart devices, regardless of their size. Oniro extends OpenHarmony code base with add-ons for the European and Global markets, such as [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/) support, [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) based IDE, [Servo](https://servo.org/) web engine, and more that are coming.

## The Project

The [Oniro Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/oniro) was established through a first-of-its-kind agreement between two major global open-source foundations - The Eclipse Foundation and The OpenAtom Foundation. The collaboration aims to drive the development and global adoption of OpenHarmony. Operating within the framework of the Eclipse Foundation as a dedicated project and [Working Group](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/oniro-charter.php), the project leverages the Eclipse Foundation’s extensive experience in open-source governance. This approach fosters transparency and encourages active community participation in the project's development and ongoing evolution.

The project encompasses a diverse array of enhancements, with a particular emphasis on application frameworks, system-level OS components, and integrated development environments (IDE). It also incorporates an advanced toolchain dedicated to ensuring compliance with intellectual property and licensing standards. At its heart, Oniro is committed to providing seamless interoperability, modularization, and an intuitive, visually appealing user interface. As a versatile platform, Oniro offers comprehensive support for a variety of global technologies and applications across multiple sectors, including Consumer Electronics, Home Appliances, Industrial IoT, Smart Home, and Multimedia.

## The Code

The Oniro code is hosted in GitHub [Eclipse Oniro for OpenHarmony](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony) organization. Additionally, the project mirrors all repositories from Gitee [OpenHarmony organization](https://gitee.com/openharmony) to GitHub [Eclipse Oniro Mirrors organization](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro-mirrors). These mirrored repositories are *read-only* and consumed by Eclipse Oniro build system. The mirroring aims to enhance speed and reliability of the repositories' access. Additionally, it simplifies forking and consumption on GitHub. To keep the mirrors current, a synchronization CI workflow runs every 24 hours, updating them with the latest changes.


## Quick Start

To quickly start working with the code and building Oniro please follow our concise [tutorial](device-development/building-oniro.md). For those interested in experiencing its functionality on actual hardware, as a starting point, we recommend the HiHope HH-SCDAYU200 development kit, which is based on Rockchip's RK3568 processor. This kit is readily accessible in Europe and the USA, offering convenience for developers in these regions.

## Chat with Us

The Oniro Project engages in community discussions primarily through Eclipse Matrix rooms, and we warmly welcome everyone to join. Whether you seek assistance, wish to contribute, or are keen on interacting with our maintainers, contributors, and community members, the [Oniro Project room](https://matrix.to/#/#oniro-project:matrix.eclipse.org) is the ideal starting point. You can find a full list of Eclipse Oniro chat rooms [here](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#oniro:matrix.eclipse.org). Matrix provides a secure, decentralized communication network, allowing the use of existing accounts from any server. Don’t have a Matrix account? Your [Eclipse Foundation account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/) can seamlessly fulfill this role. Creating an Eclipse Foundation account is a straightforward process, ensuring quick and easy access.

## Issue Reporting

We welcome feedback and issue reports for continuous improvement of the project. If you encounter any problems or bugs, kindly report them on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony/manifest/issues). Your contributions are valuable to the project’s development.
