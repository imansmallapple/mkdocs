Before your contribution can be accepted by the project team,
contributors must electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement
(ECA)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php).

Commits must have a Signed-off-by field in the footer indicating that
the author is aware of the terms by which the contribution has been
provided to the project. Also, an associated Eclipse Foundation account
needs to be in place with a signed Eclipse Contributor Agreement on
file. These requirements are enforced by the Eclipse Foundation
infrastructure tooling.

For more information, please see the [Eclipse Committer
Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit).
