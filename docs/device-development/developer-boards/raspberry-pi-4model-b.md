# Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Development Kit

## Introduction
The Raspberry Pi 4B is powered by the Broadcom BCM2711, a quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC clocked at 1.8GHz. It offers significant performance improvements over previous models, making it an ideal choice for projects requiring higher processing power. The board also supports a variety of peripherals including high-speed USB 3.0, dual HDMI outputs, and Gigabit Ethernet.

The onboard wireless capabilities (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) and the Raspberry Pi's standard 40-pin GPIO header ensure a wide range of expansion possibilities. It’s an excellent platform for IoT, media centers, and general-purpose computing projects.

The Oniro Project supports the Raspberry Pi 4B, and the following features have been verified to be working:
- GPU graphical acceleration
- USB camera support
- HDMI output
- Touch input
- Mouse input

## Building

After completing the steps in the [quick build documentation](../building-oniro.md) to set up your build environment, proceed with the following steps to compile and build the system image for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

### Step 1: Prepare the Build Environment

Run the following script to apply system patches:

```bash
chmod 777 device/board/rpi/system_patch/system_patch.sh
./device/board/rpi/system_patch/system_patch.sh
```

### Step 2: Compile the System Image

Execute the following command to build the system image:

```bash
./build.sh --product-name rpi4 --ccache
```

### Step 3: Package the System Image

Once the compilation is complete, package the image using this command:

```bash
./build.sh --product-name rpi4 --ccache --build-target rpi_image
```

The compiled files will be archived in the `out/rpi4/` directory, and the final image will be located at:

```
out/rpi4/packages/phone/images/
```

## Flashing

To flash the image, follow these steps in a Linux environment:

#### Step 1: Insert the SD Card

Insert your SD card (at least 16GB) into the card reader and connect it to your computer.

#### Step 2: Identify the Device

Run the following command to list all connected devices:

```bash
lsblk
```

Locate your SD card by identifying its size in the list. The device name will be something like `/dev/sdX`, where `X` is a letter such as `b`, `c`, etc. For example, it could be `/dev/sdc`.

#### Step 3: Unmount the Device

If the device has any mounted partitions, you must unmount them before flashing the image. For example, if your device is `/dev/sdc`, run the following command to unmount all partitions:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdc*
```

#### Step 4: Flash the Image

Now, use the `dd` command to write the image file to the SD card. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the appropriate device name (e.g., `/dev/sdc`), and run the following command:

```bash
sudo dd if=out/rpi4/packages/phone/images/rpi_image.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
```

This will begin the flashing process. The `status=progress` option will display the progress of the flashing process.

#### Step 5: Eject the SD Card

Once the flashing is complete, safely eject the SD card using the following command:

```bash
sudo eject /dev/sdX
```

You can now insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi 4B for use.

## Debugging

### 1. Connecting via Serial

To debug via serial, use the following pin configuration:

![Serial Pin Configuration](images/raspberry-po-4-model-b/rpi4b-gpio.png)

Connect the pins as shown in the diagram (Pins 6, 8, and 10). Then, use the following Minicom command to establish the serial connection:

```bash
sudo minicom --device /dev/ttyUSB0 --baudrate 115200
```

Make sure to replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the appropriate serial port for your setup.

**Tip:** After establishing the serial connection, you will have access to the device's shell. If the device is connected to a network, you can retrieve the IP address by running the `ifconfig` command. This will be useful for the next section on "Using the HDC Tool" to connect to the device over the network.

### 2. Using the HDC Tool

The HDC tool can be used for various debugging tasks. To connect, first connect the device via Ethernet to obtain the IP address, and then run the following command:

```bash
hdc tconn <device-ip>:5555
```

You should see `Connect OK` if the connection is successful.

Here are some useful HDC commands:

- `hdc shell`: Opens a shell to the device.
- `hdc file send {local_path} {device_path}`: Sends a file from your local system to the device.
- `hdc file recv {device_path} {local_path}`: Receives a file from the device.
- `hdc install <filename.hap>`: Installs a `.hap` package on the device.
