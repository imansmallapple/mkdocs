Oniro IDE is built using [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/docs/), which is heavily influenced by VS Code. The languages supported by the IDE are all those supported by VS Code. Examples of such are:

|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
|[![Python](assets/images/python.png)**Python**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)|[![Alt text](assets/images/c-c++.png)**C/C++**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)|[![Alt text](assets/images/cs.png)**C#**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp)|
|[![Alt text](assets/images/Go.png)**Go**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)|[![Alt text](assets/images/java.png) **Java**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)|[![Alt text](assets/images/js.png)**Javascript**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript)|

The Language Features are also shared with those in VS Code:
- Syntax highlighting and bracket matching
- Smart completions
- Linting and corrections
- Code navigation
- Debugging
- Refactoring
