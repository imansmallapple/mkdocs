# Device Development

This section provides an overview and entry points for developing devices with Eclipse Oniro, which is based on OpenHarmony and currently focuses on the standard system type.

## System Types

OpenHarmony defines three system types: Mini, Small, and Standard.  
- **Mini system**: For devices with MCUs (e.g., Arm Cortex-M, 32-bit RISC-V) and ≥128 KiB RAM. Offers lightweight networking, graphics, and IoT bus support. Typical products: sensors, wearables, connection modules.
- **Small system**: For devices with application processors (e.g., Arm Cortex-A) and ≥1 MiB RAM. Provides higher security, standard graphics, and video capabilities. Typical products: smart cameras, routers, EDRs.
- **Standard system**: Oniro currently targets this type, designed for devices with application processors (e.g., Arm Cortex-A) and at least 128 MiB of RAM. The standard system provides a complete application framework, 3D GPU support, hardware composer, and a wide range of components and animations. Typical products include high-end displays and smart appliances.

## Development Flow

1. **Obtaining the Source Code**  
   Follow the instructions in [Building Oniro](building-oniro.md) to fetch the source code and set up your environment.

2. **Supported Hardware**  
   See [Developer Boards](developer-boards/index.md) for details on supported hardware. Currently, Oniro actively supports the HiHope HH-SCDAYU200 and Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, with step-by-step build and flashing instructions for each.

3. **Building and Flashing**  
   - Use Docker for a clean build environment.  
   - Set the target device (e.g., `rk3568` for HiHope, `rpi4` for Raspberry Pi).  
   - Flashing instructions are hardware-specific and detailed in each board's documentation.

4. **Debugging and Tools**  
   - Use the HDC tool for device communication and debugging.  
   - Serial console access and other debugging tips are provided per board.
