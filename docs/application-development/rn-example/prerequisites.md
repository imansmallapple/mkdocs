# Prerequisites

## npm Installation

npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool for managing Node.js packages, essential for both front-end and back-end projects. In most cases, npm is installed alongside Node.js.

### Step 1: Install Node.js (including npm)

1. Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) and download the installer.
2. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

### Step 2: Verify the npm Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Enter the command:
    ```bash
    npm --version
    ```
3. If the terminal displays a version number, npm has been successfully installed.

### Step 3: Update npm (Optional)

To update npm globally to the latest version, run:
```bash
npm install -g npm
```

## Building the React Native Framework from Source

### Cloning the Repository

Follow these steps to clone the project repository:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitee.com/openharmony-sig/ohos_react_native.git
    ```
3. Change to the newly created project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ohos_react_native
    ```
4. Initialize and update all submodules:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
5. Once cloning and submodule updating are complete, the project is ready for further setup and development.

### Compilation of the Framework and Sample Tester Application

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `react-native-harmony-cli` directory, then run:
    ```bash
    npm i && npm pack
    ```
2. Navigate to the `react-native-harmony-sample-package` directory, then run:
    ```bash
    npm i && npm pack
    ```
3. Enter the `tester` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm run i
    ```
    _(Note: Use 'npm run i' instead of 'npm i'.)_
    
4. While in the `tester` directory, start the Metro server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Set the environment variable `RNOH_C_API_ARCH` to `1`.
6. Open the `tester/harmony` project in DevEco Studio and wait for background synchronization to complete.
7. Connect your device.
8. In DevEco Studio, navigate to **File > Project Structure > Signing Configs**, log in, and follow the signing process.
9. Select the `entry` configuration located at the top-right.
10. Click the **Run 'entry'** button at the top-right to launch the project.
