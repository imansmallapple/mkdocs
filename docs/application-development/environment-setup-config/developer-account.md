[HUAWEI ID Registration and Verification | HUAWEI Developers](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/start/registration-and-verification-0000001053628148)

In simple terms, anyone can register for an individual developer account, whether they choose to verify their identity or not.  However, it's said that certain permissions require an identity verification with the identity document. 

According to information from the Huawei developer forum, verified developers gain access to more development resources, training materials, and market promotion. Moreover, only verified developers are allowed to publish applications.

Enterprise developers receive a broader range of services compared to individual developers. Here's a breakdown:
