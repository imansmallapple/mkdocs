# State Management

This section covers the key concepts, decorators, and storage mechanisms used for managing state in ArkTS/ArkUI applications.

State management in ArkTS/ArkUI enables you to build dynamic, interactive UIs by keeping your applicationâ€™s data and UI in sync. This documentation explains the main concepts, decorators, and storage solutions available for handling state at different scopes and lifecycles.

## Key Topics Covered

- **`@State` Decorator**  
  Declares reactive local state within a component. Changes to `@State` variables automatically trigger UI updates.

- **Other Decorators**  
  Enable one-way or two-way data binding, state sharing between components, and listening for state changes:
  - `@Prop`
  - `@Link`
  - `@ObjectLink`
  - `@StorageProp`
  - `@StorageLink`
  - `@LocalStorageProp`
  - `@LocalStorageLink`
  - `@Provide`
  - `@Consume`
  - `@Watch`

- **AppStorage**  
  A global, application-wide storage for sharing state across all components and pages. Supports decorators for automatic UI synchronization.

- **LocalStorage**  
  Provides in-memory storage for sharing state between components or pages within a limited scope. Offers decorators for one-way and two-way binding.

- **PersistentStorage**  
  Persists selected AppStorage attributes to device storage, ensuring state is retained across app restarts.

- **`$$` Operator**  
  Enables two-way synchronization between TypeScript variables and built-in component state.

- **State Management Patterns**  
  Examples and scenarios for using the above mechanisms in real applications.
