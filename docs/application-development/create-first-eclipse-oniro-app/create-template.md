In DevEco Studio, a project template serves as a blueprint for building specific types of apps. It defines the project structure and essential files, providing starter code to help you get started quickly.

3. Make sure the `Application` tab is selected on the left bar, then choose `[OpenHarmony]Empty Ability` as project template and click `Next`.

4. Configure your project with following information:  

- The **Project name** field is used to enter the name of your project.

- The **Bundle name** field represents the package name, which also serves as the default application ID. Keep it as default to maintain the file organization.

- The **Save location** field specifies where all project files are stored, you can leave it as default.  

- The **Compile SDK** specifies the API version used for compilation. By default, **API 11** is selected in our case, which also sets **ArkTS** as the development language.  

- Select **Stage** for **Model** and keep the default values for all other parameters.

>**Note:**
 If you plan to use **JavaScript**, select **API 8** instead. This will provide a language option where you can choose **JS**.
