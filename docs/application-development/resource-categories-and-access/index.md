# Resource Categories and Access

During application development, you may need to use different resources, such as **colors**, **fonts**, **spacing**, and **images**, based on the device or configuration. Depending on the resource type, you can achieve this using the following methods:

- **Application resources**: configure device- or configuration-specific resources in the resource files.

- **System resources**: Obtain the ID and configuration-specific values of colors, fonts, or other resources in [Resources](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/design/ux-design/design-resources.md); obtain system icons in [HarmonyOS Symbol](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/design/harmonyos-symbol/).
